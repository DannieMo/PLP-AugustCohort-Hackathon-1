# Portfolio-Website

- This project is a Hackathon Challenge for the August Cohort of Power Learn Project Africa. PLP Africa is a Software Engineering Academy with a mission to train software engineers in Africa for Africa and the world.  
  In this portfolio website, i did the following:
- Enabled website responsiveness (on mobile and desktop) by adapting the use of media queries.
- Embedded form spree into my project to be able to send messages.
- I added links to my nav bar. Clicking on each item or icon on the nav bar will lead to that section of the website (but i supplied the field with a dead-link). You should try iy outüòç
